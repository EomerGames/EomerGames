**Good afternoon! I'm Eomer, @EomerGames.**

I'm a hobbyist programmer. I've dabbled in C, C++, 6502 Assembly, and C# with Unity. More recently, I've been familiarising myself with Godot.

At present I'm working on Project Wyrdtide, a Godot game written primarily in GDScript but with some C# thrown into the mix.

You can reach me on eomer@eomer.co.uk
